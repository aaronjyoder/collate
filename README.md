# Collate
This program allows you to test core-to-core latency. It tests round-trip core-to-core latency (cache coherence latency) using a contested lock test with atomic compare and set instructions.

Future tests may be added in the future. If you have deeper low-level knowledge of Java, please do reach out to me and explain if I am doing anything naive or wrong. I would like to fix any issues ASAP.
